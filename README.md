Customize Posts WordPress Plugin
================================

Edit posts and postmeta in the Customizer

The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see.

This **Customize Posts** plugin is not to be confused with 10up's [**Post Customizer**](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer) plugin which is a complimentary effort but seeks to address differnt use cases. The two plugin projects have [opened a discussion](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer/issues/9#issuecomment-43821746) to collaborate where possible.
